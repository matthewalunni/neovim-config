# üí§ LazyVim Cheatsheet

A quick reference for working efficiently in LazyVim.  
This covers common actions including **files, buffers, git, search, commands, terminal, and more**.  
(Default `<leader>` is `space` unless you‚Äôve changed it.)

## üìù Vim Modes

Vim (and LazyVim) works by switching between modes. Each mode changes what your keys do.

| Mode                 | How to Enter                                                                                    | How to Exit / Switch                                        | Purpose                                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Normal** (default) | Press `<esc>` or start Vim                                                                      | Always return here with `<esc>`                             | Navigation, editing commands, motions                      |
| **Insert**           | `i` (insert before cursor) <br> `a` (after) <br> `o` (new line below) <br> `O` (new line above) | `<esc>` ‚Üí back to Normal <br> `<C-c>` also works            | Typing and inserting text                                  |
| **Visual**           | `v` (characterwise) <br> `V` (linewise) <br> `<C-v>` (blockwise)                                | `<esc>` ‚Üí back to Normal                                    | Selecting text for copying, deleting, formatting           |
| **Select**           | `gh`                                                                                            | Typing replaces the selection                               | Similar to Visual but acts like a GUI editor               |
| **Replace**          | `R`                                                                                             | `<esc>`                                                     | Overwrites text instead of inserting                       |
| **Command-line**     | `:` (Ex commands) <br> `/` (search forward) <br> `?` (search backward)                          | `<esc>`                                                     | Run commands, search, substitute                           |
| **Terminal**         | `:terminal` or `<leader>tt` (Snacks terminal)                                                   | `<C-\><C-n>` ‚Üí Normal mode <br> `i` ‚Üí back to Terminal mode | Interact with a shell inside Neovim                        |
| **Operator-pending** | Triggered by operators like `d`, `y`, `c`                                                       | Complete with a motion (e.g. `w`, `ap`)                     | Awaiting a motion to act on text (e.g. `dw` = delete word) |

---

### üîë Quick Notes

- **Normal mode** is your home base. Think _"verbs"_ (delete, yank, change) combined with _"objects"_ (word, paragraph, block).
- **Visual mode** is for selecting before acting, while **Operator-pending** lets you act then choose a motion.
- **Terminal mode** behaves like insert mode but is bound to a shell. Exit with `<C-\><C-n>`.
- **Command-line mode** gives you `:` commands and `/` searches.

---

## üèÉ Motions & Text Objects

In **Normal**, **Visual**, or **Operator-pending** mode, motions and text objects define _what_ your command acts on.  
For example:

- `dw` = delete (`d`) + motion (`w` ‚Üí word)
- `yap` = yank (`y`) + text object (`ap` ‚Üí a paragraph)

### üîπ Text Objects

Text objects always begin with `a` (around) or `i` (inside).

| Object      | Meaning                           | Examples                                                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aw`        | A word (includes space)           | `daw` = delete word + trailing space                        |
| `iw`        | Inner word (no space)             | `diw` = delete just the word                                |

| `i"`        | Inner quoted string               | `di"` = delete inside `"hello"` ‚Üí hello gone, quotes remain |
| `a'`        | A single-quoted string            | `da'` = delete `'abc'` incl. quotes                         |

### üß† Pro Tips

- Think **verb + object**: `d` = delete, `y` = yank, `c` = change.
- Combine with counts: `3dw` deletes 3 words.
- Use **text objects** for structured editing (quotes, brackets, functions).
- Motions work in **Normal**, **Visual**, and **Operator-pending** modes.

- Use multiple terminals for running servers, git, and build tools simultaneously.
- Floating terminals are great for quick commands (like `lazygit` or `npm run dev`).

# Tips

- `<leader>` = `space` (by default).
- Use `:Lazy` to open LazyVim plugin manager.
- Use `:checkhealth` to troubleshoot issues.
- Press `K` on a symbol for hover docs.
